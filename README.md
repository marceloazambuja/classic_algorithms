# My solutions for classic algorithms using C++ and Python.

The idea is to have a solution for each problem/algorithm both in C++ and Python, whenever it's possible.

The C++ codes are in main directory. Actually, as I use XCode, each C++ solution has a self directory, so it's needed enter this directory and enter again in the directory with the name of algorithm (the directory whose name doesn't have the *.xcodeproj*)  
  
Python codes are in **/pythonSolutions** directory.
